  id: ID!
  programID: ID! @index(name: "byProgram")
  studentID: ID! @index(name: "byStudent")
  fullName: String!
  email: String!
  phone: String
  statementOfPurpose: String
  status: ApplicationStatus!
  submittedAt: AWSDateTime
  reviewedAt: AWSDateTime
  reviewedBy: String # Admin ID who reviewed
  reviewNotes: String
  createdAt: AWSDateTime!
  updatedAt: AWSDateTime!
}

enum ApplicationStatus {
  pending
  approved
  rejected
  withdrawn
}
```

### Key Features
- **Authentication**: Owner-based access for students, admin group access for management
